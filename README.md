# CS210---Programming-Languages

My code for project three chada techs corner grocer was shorter than my previous projects but still took me some time to work through. The project required a class with a public and private section so within my class I implemented a function to house my map for my grocery items as well as the bulk of the program output. This includes the user input, the for loop to search and print out the desired item and its quantity. I kept all of this within the private section and then called it from the public section. Afterwards it was simply calling the function from our main cpp file and letting the program run. Im still very new to coding and c++ in general so Iâ€™m always second guessing my work. The biggest hurdle I need to tackle right now is my time management but overall I think it went well. This was my first attempt at working with maps so I could definitely use some more practice in that department but overall everything needs work. This project was another nice test to see where Im at and the skills taken from this course will help me in the future.
